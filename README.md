# freebots
Simple example of a 3D robotics simulation in python, ODE, OpenGL.  Maybe useful for you to fork to build your own robot simulations based on it, if you don't want to work in Gazebo etc and prefer to work at the lower ODE/OpenGL level.

It was developed as a free alternative to "Webots" when that was propriatory; for the paper
"Technical integration of hippocampus, basal ganglia and physical models for spatial navigation" available at
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.11.006.2009/full
(The code also includes bio-inspired basal ganglia and hippocampus modules and touch sensing bending whisker physics from this paper).
Please cite the paper if you find Freebots useful in your own research.
