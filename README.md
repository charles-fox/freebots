# freebots
Simple example of a 3D robotics simulation in Python, ODE, and OpenGL.  Maybe useful for you to fork to build your own robot simulations based on it, if you don't want to work in Gazebo/Webots etc and prefer to work at the lower ODE/OpenGL level.  Or if you want to make a 3D game without Godot/Unity etc.

It was developed as a free alternative to "Webots" when that was propriatory; for the paper
"Technical integration of hippocampus, basal ganglia and physical models for spatial navigation" available at
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.11.006.2009/full
(The code also includes bio-inspired basal ganglia and hippocampus modules and touch sensing bending whisker physics from this paper).
Please cite the paper if you find Freebots useful in your own research.
