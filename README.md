3D robotics simulation 

Maybe useful as a base for other people's sims, if you don't want to work in Gazebo etc and prefer to work at the lower ODE/OpenGL level.

(includes bio-inspired basal ganglia and hippocampus modules from the paper
"Technical integration of hippocampus, basal ganglia and physical models for spatial navigation" )
